            <p><b>Want to know about the team behind Higher Thoughts?</b></p>
            <p>Take a scroll down and look at each team member involved in the project Higher Thoughts. The group started this project with the idea to address the social issues that can impact us today as well as make sure audiences can gain a new understanding of issues relevant in today’s society. By doing so you might also want to know the team behind the debates:

                <p>My whole life I’ve been thoroughly invested in the social justice of others. With a keen eye on creative media, it’s always been my dream to create a collaborative piece of media that incorporates debating in depth about social justice issues and eastern philosophy. Having been raised in London by two South African parents, I’ve been made aware of the differences in culture in a country such as ours and have been desensitised to the inequality that many members of society face. This has spurred my interest and motivated me to speak out about what can so easily be swept under the rug. Wake up England!</p>

                <p>Gandhi said that “whatever you do in life will be insignificant, but it's very important that you do it because nobody else will”.  I think to a certain extent Ghandi was right.  Were all doing things because we need to survive, pass time, and go through the motions in life. How many of us, want to make an impact on someone else life, hence our show, wants to aware you, help you make a difference to somebody else life.</p>

I am so pleased that we are addressing the social issues that are tackled in everyday life, the idea of having a debate show about it meant that we were able to review different views and opinions.</p>
