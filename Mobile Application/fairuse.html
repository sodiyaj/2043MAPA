          <p>Fair use, is the use of copyrighted material done for “transformative purposes, that can be used to critique, or for parody purposes.</p>

          <p>When using copyrighted material, one must ask the following; has the material you have taken from the original work been transformed by adding new expression or meaning? And was value added to the original by creating new information, new aesthetics, new insights, and understandings?</p>

          <p>Why the topic has become ever so hot, is through the existence of YouTube. YouTube is a videoing app, and many people use it, to platform their videos.  In their videos, they may use existent art work or background music that is owned by existing artist. This work could not be copyrighted or stolen without the user’s authority.</p>
