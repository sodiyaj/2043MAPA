                    <p> Gandhi said that “whatever you do in life will be insignificant, but it's very important that you do it because nobody else will”.  I think to a certain extent Ghandi was right.  Were all doing things because we need to survive, pass time, and go through the motions in life. How many of us, want to make an impact on someone else life, hence our show, wants to aware you, help you make a difference to somebody else life.</p>

                    <p> My whole life I’ve been thoroughly invested in the social justice of others. With a keen eye on creative media, it’s always been my dream to create a collaborative piece of media that incorporates debating in depth about social justice issues and eastern philosophy. Having been raised in London by two South African parents, I’ve been made aware of the differences in culture in a country such as ours and have been desensitised to the inequality that many members of society face. This has spurred my interest and motivated me to speak out about what can so easily be swept under the rug. Wake up England! </p>

Doing a debate show was a great idea, as this enabled us to have different views and opinions on the social issues we all face in our everyday life. </p>
